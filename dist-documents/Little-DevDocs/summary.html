<h3>Introductions</h3>
<p>
    Little DevDocs is a high-level documentation for my game- Little survival, and the framework behind it.
</p>
<p>
    Little survival's documentation is split into multiple parts- 
    </p><ol>
        <li>This page, explaining the general structure, where to find what, and how to do what.</li>
        <li>Docstrings within the codebase, responsible for explaining what each function does.</li>
        <li>The code and commits (Use git blame), if there're any more fine-grained details you need to check. It should be readable enough but obviously, no developer can fully vouch for the clarity of their own spaghetti.</li>
        <li>Ask Nanior, if even he can't figure it out... Well, hang him.</li>
    </ol>
