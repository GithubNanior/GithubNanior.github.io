<h3>Base stats</h3>
<br>
There're 9 stats representing base traits of your body, which cannot be increased by choice, as warriors for example would obviously straight up spend all skill points on strength.<br>

            <summary><b>Strength</b></summary>
            <br>
            This is your physical power, it may represent your strength when using one hand, your ability to move your own weight and so on.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>You may "increase" your strength by using both hands</strong> when holding something, mostly by 50%, but it can go up to 100% in optimal situations like weightlifting.

            <summary><b>Weight</b></summary>
            <br>
            The total weight of your body, armor and everything else, it affects how easy it is to move yourself or for others to move you, and affects certain actions like stomping.<br>
            <br>
            A creature's weight is actually how much it weigh to itself, <strong>a creature's actual weight is double their weight stat</strong>.

        <details>
            <summary><b>Reflex</b></summary>
            <br>
            This is for how fast you can react to events, it's typically used for reflex dodges, the other type of dodge being intentionally moving/leaping out of the enemy's attack range.<br>
            <br>
            Mostly a dodge that would keep you within the enemy's attack range is considered a reflex dodge.

        <details>
            <summary><b>Charisma</b></summary>
            <br>
            Your physical and magical attractiveness.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Charm is countered by will, not intelligence</strong>, no matter magical or physical, as it's irrational behaviour.<br>
            <br>
            If you invested in charisma as a tool of manipulation, please remember- If the one you're trying to manipulate is smart enough to see through you, and has the will to resist your charm, a beautiful face won't save your ass.

            <br>
            Intelligence represents the ability to deduce information, the player can't see everything, so the character can help as the player knows what they're thinking about.<br>
            A dumb character might end up misleading their player, though.

<h3>Derived stats</h3>
<br>
Certain stats depend on the base stats, the situation you find yourself in, whether you expected it and so on.<br>
<br>
<div class="flex column gap-10">
    <section>
        <details>
            <summary><b>Movement speed</b></summary>
            <br>
            <small><b>Movement speed</b> = <b>Strength - Weight</b>.<br></small>
            <br>
            Your speed limit for moving without any kind of penalty to other actions.<br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Running</strong> doubles your movement speed, it's the fastest you can move, but there's a penalty on certain actions while doing so.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaping</strong> has a speed value of triple your movement speed, but you're considered suspended until your leap finish, so play it smart.</li>
            </ul>

<h3>Skills</h3>
<br>
Skills are bits of knowledge and techniques that may help you with specific tasks, skills can be as specific or as generalized as the player wish, so we won't list any out.<br>
<br>
Skills can be upgraded with exp equivalent to the absolute value of the skill bonus +1.<br>
For example if you have -3 stabbing, you will have to spend 4 exp points to turn it to -2.<br>
So handicaps can be kind of a big deal.
