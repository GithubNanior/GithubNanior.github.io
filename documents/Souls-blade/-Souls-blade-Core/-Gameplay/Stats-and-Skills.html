<h3>Base stats</h3>
<br>
There're 9 stats representing base traits of your body, which cannot be increased by choice, as warriors for example would obviously straight up spend all skill points on strength.<br>

            <summary><b>Strength</b></summary>
            <br>
            This is your physical power, it may represent your strength when using one hand, your ability to move your own weight and so on.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>You may "increase" your strength by using both hands</strong> when holding something, around 50% extra if both are on the hilt, and up to 100% if your two hands are apart.

            <summary><b>Weight</b></summary>
            <br>
            The total weight of your body, armor and everything else, it affects how easy it is to move yourself or for others to move you, and affects certain actions like stomping.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Your own bodyweight only has 1/3 effect on yourself</strong>, including armor and accessories, this does not count for tools and weapons unless if you're carrying them on your shoulder.

        <details>
            <summary><b>Speed</b></summary>
            <br>
            This represents how quickly you can move, no matter how strong you are, the speed of your limbs has a threshold.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>This is actually you speed when walking quickly</strong>, you can bypass it by leaping, jumping, sprinting and so on, sacrificing control for speed.

        <details>
            <summary><b>Reflex</b></summary>
            <br>
            This is for how fast you can react to events, it comes in to play when you're trying to evade an attack at close notice, or whether you can even notice an incoming attack.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>You try to protect yourself by reflex</strong> if your reflex is lower than the attack's speed, in which case you don't get to decide what you do, and your moves may not be good either.

            <summary><b>Charisma</b></summary>

            Your physical and magical attractiveness.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Charm is countered by will, not intelligence</strong>, no matter magical or physical, as it's irrational behaviour.<br>
            <br>
            If you invested in charisma as a tool of manipulation, please remember- If the one you're trying to manipulate is smart enough to see through you, and has the will to resist your charm, a beautiful face won't save your ass.

<h3>Derived stats</h3>
<br>
Certain stats depend on the base stats, the situation you find yourself in, whether you expected it and so on.<br>
<br>
<div class="flex column gap-10">
    <section>
        <details>
            <summary><b>Movement speed</b></summary>
            <br>
            <small><b>Movement speed</b> = Lowest between <b>Speed</b> and <b>Strength - Weight/3</b>.<br></small>
            <br>
            Your speed limit for moving with full control, formulas same or similar to this one is used for most movements of your body.<br>
            <br>
            Here, <small><b>Speed</b></small> represents your speed if your strength is optimal for your weight, while <small><b>Strength - Weapon weight</b></small> is when you aren't strong enough for your weight.<br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Running</strong> will normally increase your movement speed by 50%, but it's harder for you to turn or stop in track.</li>
                <li><strong>Sprinting</strong> doubles your movement speed, it's the fastest you can move, but it's nearly impossible to turn or stop in track without .</li>
                <li><strong>Leaping and Jumping</strong> has a speed value of double your movement speed too, but obviously you can't move aside in mid air, so play it smart.</li>
            </ul>
        </details>
    </section>
    <section>
        <details>
            <summary><b>Attack speed</b></summary>
            <br>
            <small><b>Attack speed</b> = Lowest between <b>Speed</b> and <b>Strength - Weapon weight</b>.<br></small>
            <br>
            Your attack speed for swinging with full control.<br>
            <br>
            In this formula, <small><b>Speed</b></small> represents your speed for unarmed attacks, while <small><b>Strength - Weapon weight</b></small> is when your weapon is too heavy for you to swing as fast as you punch.<br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Heavy swing</strong> can let you increase your attack speed up to double, but not beyond your speed stat. You'll have trouble stopping your weapon's momentum quickly, leaving you vulnerable.</li>
                <li><strong>Lunge attacks</strong> allow you to increase your attack speed by your movement speed, they're often predictable however, or require good positioning.</li>
            </ul>

<h3>Skills</h3>
<br>
Skills are bits of knowledge and techniques that may help you with specific tasks, skills can be as specific or as generalized as the player wish, so we won't list any out.<br>
<br>
<section>
    <h4>Skill points system</h4>
    <br>
    They can be bought with exp equivalent to the absolute value of the skill bonus +1.<br>
    For example if you have -3 stabbing, you will have to spend 4 exp points to turn it to -2.<br>
    So handicaps can be kind of a big deal.<br>
