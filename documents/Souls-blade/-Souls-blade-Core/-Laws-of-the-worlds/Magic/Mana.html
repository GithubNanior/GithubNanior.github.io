<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    As like many others worlds, Mana in Souls blade can be found everywhere, it lingers in the atmosphere, it's traces can be found in even the deepest rocks below and beyond the skies above.
</p>
<p>
    These... <em>Particles</em> at the same time appear quite physical, yet at the same time, it doesn't actually behave as a matter either.<br>
    In fact, it's actually something entirely different interacting with the physical world we know, it's channeled by some matter, yet blocked out by others, like water on uneven land...
</p>
<section>
    There are actually many, many more types of mana than people can perceive or use.

<h3>Mana types</h3>
<p>
    Sometimes mana can be combined, to create new types with new properties, sometimes special conditions are necessary, when multiple mana are bound together, it's called a mana compound.
</p>
<section>
    One of the most common and simple mana types is shadow, it's the negatively charged base and highly reactive due to the negative charge and simplicity, its disappearance is when it binds with something else or absorbs energy.<br>
    Due to the nature of shadow mana, it's denser in colder and darker areas. Leading to shadows roaming in all the larger numbers in dark nights.<br>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Positif mana</strong> has highly differing effects, even though many effects, of essence is the same: light, energy, heat, and arguably, shield.</li>
        <li><strong>Negatif mana</strong> contains shadow mana and other related mana compounds that absorbs more energy then a little bit of heat or photon: frost, and void.</li>
        <li><strong>Mana compound</strong> includes any mana composed of more mana, it's not necessarily positif nor negatif of value.</li>
    </ul>

    <em>Note: The naming of positif and negatif mana's removal is considered, although there will always be a pattern that certain mana tend to react by absorbing energy, while others release it.</em>

<h3>Mana containers</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Dissolution</strong> is the name of one way objects could contain mana, the verb is dissolve, the following properties applies to containment via dissolvance:
        <ul>
            <li>The mana contained within will spread equally the container volume.</li>
            <li>Mana within such state naturally form waves, displaying beautiful patterns when inside a transparent container.</li>
            <li>The container would absorb mana from the environment, absorbtion speed is influenced by multiple factors.</li>
            <li>The mana within can be extracted and used by souls aligned with that mana type, acting as batteries. Whether this feature can be used to power an artifact relies on whether the creature can absorb the mana, and whether the creature can supply the mana to the artifact.</li>
            <li>As the container's volume increases, the mana capacity does too, in fact the less surface area the same volume has, the more mana can be stored.</li>
            <li>At the same time, the larger a container's surface is, the faster it will absorb mana from the environment.</li>
            <li>If a container's material has an absorbtion strength stronger than a compound's bond or the resistance of it's components, it will convert the mana type into it's own.</li>
        </ul>
    
        Objects containing mana via dissolvance are basically materials being naturally aligned with the mana type.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <strong>Alloyance</strong> is the name of the other way objects could contain mana, there's no specific verb, in this case, the following properties applies:
        <ul>
            <li>The mana within the container has a pretty much fixed location and wouldn't spread to other parts of the container.</li>
            <li>The mana would be released when the material's no longer solid.</li>
            <li>One cannot extract the mana from the material, at best it will drag the whole volume along.</li>
        </ul>

        Objects containing mana via alloyance are basically mana being forced inside a solid object and frozen in place.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Mana Crystals</h3>
<p>
    Mana crystals are gems or similar shinies that absorbs mana while retaining it in a fluid manner, meaning that the mana can be extracted the same way certain souls can absorb mana from the environment.<br>
    The crystal exclusive term comes from the exquisite apperance those gems take on, highly valued in early times and still is in certain regions.
