    <h3>About Nanior</h3>
    Welcome to Souls blade!<br>
    This all started as a verbal and gesture game created by me and my brother which we played for many years, called &#28982;&#21518;&#21602;, due to how often we say it when playing, like proceeding a cutscene in video games.
    Although my brother kind of stopped playing, I moved on to hosting games for other people on Discord!<br>
