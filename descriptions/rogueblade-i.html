    <h3>Description</h3>
    A short skill based combat game with rogue-like elements! Learn how to fight, clear the floors, buy upgrades and prepare for a showdown against the final boss!
    <br>
    The game is actually beatable with beginner weapon and no upgrades, but it promises to be challenging ;)
</p>
<p>
    Hope you enjoy and good luck!

    <em>P.s the game is far harder on touchscreen devices.</em>

    <h3>Development</h3>
    I made it during the last 7 days of my holidays and it was considered completed, but I did some refinement and mobile support afterwards.
