    <h3>Description</h3>
    A game I made within a week when I versus my brother in making the best pong... 
    The results are debatable- My brother yield when he saw what I was making and found his classic pong shameful, but on second note, <strong>this isn't even pong, this is fking BrickBreaker!</strong>
</p>
<p>
    I'm sure how the game works is self-explanatory- <strong>Just pong 'em!</strong>&nbsp;

    <em>P.S. If you're really lost about why you can't hurt the second boss- You were meant to hit his head lol</em>
