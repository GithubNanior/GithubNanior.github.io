    <h3>About the game</h3>
    I decided to improve some aspects of RogueBlade I, which... Well, to be honest, didn't look too nice... So yeah, here we are! RogueBlade II, much improved compared to it's prequel! 
    <br>
    Or not... The prequel got updated soon after with it's own new features, and now it's RB I (Dark, mysterious, difficult) vs RB II (Polished, joyful, relaxed)
    <br>
    <em>P.S I'll add merchants and multiple floors back as coins are not useable here, although how I'll progress also depends on the feedback I get, so please do write a comment for expansions you wish to see, or things you dislike!</em>
