                    Hiya! I'm Nanior, I make games and some simulations!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also like to play games, specifically strategy, sandbox survival, rogue-like, souls-like and rpg games!
                    <br>
                    My love for Sandbox survival, rogue-like and souls-like games is what lead me to developing <a href="https://danior.itch.io/a-little-survival">A little survival</a>!

                <hr>
                <p>
                    I've actually been programming games in Unity since many, many years by now. 
                    Since at least the age of 10, I think? 
                    <br>
                    Although in the foremost years I wasn't taking it seriously at all, but I 
                    gradually started taking it more seriously as I grew older.
                    <br>
                    Along the way, I also have experience making games on a graphics calculator, 
                    with barebones C#, have some experience with C, C++, Python and other stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although I must admit, my liking for game development is... A little weird, 
                    as I found myself enjoying designing and making the game's framework, adding 
                    few pieces of content to test the design, but struggling to push myself to 
                    actually add content and polishing for gameplay.
                    <br>
                    So... I guess I can't actually be an indie developer, but need to find my 
                    place in a team instead, as I can't do it all alone.
