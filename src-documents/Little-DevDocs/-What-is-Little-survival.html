<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    Little survival, my blend of fight, explore, survive and loot, somewhere between being a Rogue-like and a survival sandbox, 
    where despite the innocent name, blocky graphics and (fairly) vibrant colors, is actually about hardcore survival in a dangerous world.

            <u>Each new beginning, each new world could be very different</u>, the things you lack as a beginner is different, so are the biomes and foes!
        </li>
        <li>
            <u>Limited in numbers but miniboss-like enemies</u>, or rather souls-like, 
            they're mostly less easy to fight but you can usually avoid having to face multiple at the same time.

            Despite being hardcore, <u>players can obtain extra lives</u> with each milestone in the game.

        <li>
            <u>There're things you could do that doesn't involve combat!</u> So that you have something to do while waiting things out, or get stronger in a more casual way.
        </li>

            Keep in mind that <u>there're also dangers approaching gradually</u>, like the first night, the first winter, and random events 
            (Just so that the player never feel completely safe)
