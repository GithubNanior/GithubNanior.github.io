<h3>General design</h3>
<p>
    Little survival's design is rather similar to a Rogue-like, taking inspiration from Rogue-likes and Survival sandboxes might be a good idea.<br>
    However keep in mind that, to make something novel, it's better to focus on centering on the implications and benefits of limited lives, 
    rather than simply piecing together whatever's cool in other survival games.
