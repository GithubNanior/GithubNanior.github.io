<h3>Introductions</h3>
<p>
    Creatures are an important part of many games, they pose a challenge, interact with the player and the world, or simply adds a spark of life. 
    So we'll be demonstrating how to make one in Little Survival step by step, specifically, we'll be making a Goblin here.

<h3>1. Creating the prefab</h3>
<p>
Firstly, we need to create a model, in our specific case we simply made a goblin using transforms as pivots and cubes, but you may also make a rigged model.

<h3>2. Adding essential components and configuring the prefab</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Add the SaveableObject component, as the goblin is considered a <a href="doc:Little-DevDocs/Editor/The-Saveable-system/SaveableObject-component">SaveableObject</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add a new MonoBehaviour inheriting from Creature, it will be responsible for most of the creature's behaviours and bindings.
