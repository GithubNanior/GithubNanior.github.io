    Souls blade's content is mostly made for a medieval fantasy setting, and has a highly dynamic combat system, while trying to retain numbered stats and rules.

        To me, this system is an attempt at putting my normal way of hosting games into a numbered system.
    </p>
    <p>
        My playstyle came from my history of many years of rule-less gameplay with my brother, a game we made and called 然后呢, due to how often we say it when playing, like proceeding a cutscene in video games.<br>
    </p>

    <h4>Numbers and rules</h4>
    <p>
        This is my personal thought, but... I feel like people rely on rules too often too much, and have difficulty accepting when there're no numbers or rules to hold onto.
    </p>
    <p>
        My favourite way to host games is to go by the feel, I give the player a sheet with their items, stats relative to average person and so on...<br>
        And then use the dice to introduce some randomness, which gives me the ability to keep the game balanced, and spare the players from the worst fates...<br>
        It leads to really epic and dynamic combat too!
    </p>
    <p>
        But okay, if people insist on playing with strict rules, that's what this system was made for.
