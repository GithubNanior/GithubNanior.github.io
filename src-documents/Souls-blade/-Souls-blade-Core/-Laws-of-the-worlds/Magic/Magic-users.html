<h3>Types of magic users</h3>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Mages</strong> can control <a href="doc:Souls-blade/-Souls-blade-Core/-Laws-of-the-worlds/Magic/Mana">Mana</a> by innate means, you can't easily disarm them as their very body is a weapon.</li>
    <li><strong>DemiMages</strong> only partially innately control mana, some would refer to one who's both a wizard and a mage as a demimage</li>
    <li><strong>Wizards</strong> are beings who control mana by external means, often a weapon or an accessory.</li>
    <li>The rest are just people who use magic items, you don't become a wizard by drinking magic potions nor by using scrolls.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Mediums</h3>
<p>
    Mediums are objects that when in contact with a person, allows a person to sense and control one or more types of mana.<br>
    Even though mediums typically refer to weapons and accessories, a mage's soul technically has a medium, too.

<h3>Controlling mana</h3>
<p>
    People who control mana relies on their feeling, a sense independent from sight, hearing, or smell.<br>
    It is like an aura of their influence, weaking over distance...<br>
    This feeling is fuzzy and rarely ever lets you control the whole cloud, but everything that you already control would remain within your control until focus is dropped.
</p>
<p>
    Mana itself typically weights an insignificant amount, making it reasonably easy to control...<br>
    However, solidified mana or mana containers are practically never viable to be controlled by any normal being.

<h3>Trivia</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Funnily, blind people are typically better at sensing mana.</li>
    <li>Few can deflect magic projectiles by grabbing control of it, it's at the same time both a specialitized skill and limited by the mana types you're aligned with.</li>
    <li>When creating solid projectiles from mana, the projectile's velocity can only be induced while or before it's solidified.</li>
